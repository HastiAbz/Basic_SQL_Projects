# Advanced Employee & Department Data Retrieval


Project Overview
This project sets up a relational database for managing employee records, including their departments, salaries, and hiring details. It demonstrates various SQL JOIN operations, self-joins, and advanced query techniques to retrieve meaningful insights from employee data.

Features

1. Basic Joins
- INNER JOIN: Retrieve employees along with their department names
- LEFT JOIN: List all employees, including those without departments
- RIGHT JOIN: Show all departments, even if no employees are assigned
- FULL OUTER JOIN (Simulated using UNION)
2. Self-Joins
- Find employees hired before another employee
- Compare salaries within the company
3. Complex Queries
- Joining across multiple tables: Retrieve employee names, department names, and salary details
- Using JOIN with conditions: Filter employees hired after a certain date
- CROSS JOIN: Generate all possible combinations of employees and departments
